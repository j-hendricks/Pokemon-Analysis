# Pokemon-Analysis

## Overview

The Pokemon franchise has introduced hundreds of pokemon since the release of their first video game in the 90s. This project analyzes pokemon data from the first 7 sets of games, or "generations" as they are more commonly referred to. In total, this is 801 pokemon being anayzed. 

The data is comprised of over 40 categories. This includes typical video games stats (such as attack, defense, etc.) but also variables less related to the mechanics of the game, such as heigh and weight. The table below summarizes the types of values in the dataset.

Once the analysis was complete, the cleaned and modified dataset was stored in a sql database for future reference.
